# Coursework2
Our Coursewok 2 is the store management system which is intended to work as a way for a shop to be able to manage their inventory being able to not only view their inventory but also be able to calculate a sales report as well as being able to add and remove products so they can keep their inventory system up to date. 

This is broken down into using the javax swing to make the GUI that the user interacts with to create the workable interface as well as using multiple screens to individaulise each aspect of the code into the 3 methods of products, sales and inventory

One feature that we didnt get working was the ability to change the quantity of the product as its being changed causing an inefficeny in that you need to remove and readd the product to update its details which could be made more efficient in further developements after the coursework submission.
